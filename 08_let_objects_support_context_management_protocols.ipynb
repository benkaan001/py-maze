    "Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imports:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM`: This line imports three objects from the `socket` module:\n",
    "    - `socket`: This is the function used to create a socket object for network communication.\n",
    "    - `AF_INET`: This constant represents the IPv4 address family (the most common type of IP address).\n",
    "    - `SOCK_STREAM`: This constant represents the TCP socket type, which is used for reliable, connection-oriented communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`LazyConnection` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This class provides a way to manage network connections lazily. It establishes the connection only when needed, within the `with` block.\n",
    "  - `__init__(self, address, family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM)`: The constructor takes three arguments:\n",
    "    - `address`: A tuple containing the host (e.g., \"www.python.org\") and port (e.g., 80).\n",
    "    - `family`: (Optional) The address family, defaults to `AF_INET` (IPv4).\n",
    "    - `type`: (Optional) The socket type, defaults to `SOCK_STREAM` (TCP).\n",
    "    It initializes internal variables to store the address, family, type, and a placeholder for the socket object (`self.sock`).\n",
    "  - `__enter__(self)`: This method is called automatically when you enter the `with` block. It checks if the connection is already established (`self.sock is not None`). If not, it creates a socket using the stored address family and type (`socket(self.family, self.type)`), connects to the address (`self.sock.connect(self.address)`), and stores it in `self.sock`. Finally, it returns the socket object (`self.sock`) to be used within the `with` block.\n",
    "  - `__exit__(self, exc_ty, exc_val, tb)`: This method is called automatically when the `with` block exits, either normally or due to an exception. It closes the socket connection if it's open (`self.sock.close()`) and sets the socket object back to `None`. It also takes three arguments (`exc_ty`, `exc_val`, and `tb`) for exception handling (not used in this specific example).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from functools import partial`: This line imports the `partial` function from the `functools` module, which is used to create a partial function object.\n",
    "- `conn = LazyConnection(('www.python.org', 80))`: This line creates an instance of the `LazyConnection` class, specifying the address as a tuple containing the hostname and port for www.python.org.\n",
    "- `with conn as s`: This line uses the `LazyConnection` object with the `with` statement. Here's what happens:\n",
    "    - `conn.__enter__()` is called, which creates the connection (if necessary) and assigns the socket object to `s`.\n",
    "    - The code within the `with` block can now use the `s` object, which represents the established network connection.\n",
    "    - `conn.__exit__()` is called automatically when the `with` block exits, which closes the connection (if it was open).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `LazyConnection` class promotes lazy connection creation, improving efficiency by establishing the connection only when actually needed within the `with` block.\n",
    "- The context management protocol ensures that the connection is always closed properly, even if an exception occurs within the `with` block."
