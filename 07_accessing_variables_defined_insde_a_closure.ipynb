    "Step by step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the `sample` Function**:\n",
    "   - `sample()` is a function that doesn't take any arguments.\n",
    "   - Inside `sample()`, there's a local variable `n` set to `0`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining the `func` Function (Closure)**:\n",
    "   - Inside `sample()`, we define another function named `func`. This is what we call a closure.\n",
    "   - `func` can access and use the `n` variable from the `sample()` function's scope, even after `sample()` has finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessor Methods for `n`**:\n",
    "   - Inside `sample()`, we define two functions: `get_n()` and `set_n(value)`.\n",
    "   - `get_n()` returns the current value of `n`.\n",
    "   - `set_n(value)` sets a new value for `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Attaching Accessor Methods to the Closure**:\n",
    "   - We attach the `get_n()` and `set_n()` functions to `func` as attributes. This means `func` can now use these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Closure**:\n",
    "   - Finally, `sample()` returns the `func` function, which is a closure. It essentially \"remembers\" the `n` variable even after `sample()` has finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using the Closure (`func`) and Accessor Methods**:\n",
    "   - We call `sample()` and store the returned function in `f`.\n",
    "   - We call `f()`, which prints the initial value of `n` (which is `0`).\n",
    "   - We call `f.set_n(10)` to set a new value for `n`.\n",
    "   - We call `f()`, which now prints the updated value of `n` (which is `10`).\n",
    "   - We call `f.get_n()`, which prints and returns the current value of `n` (which is `10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this code demonstrates how a closure (`func`) can remember and access variables from the scope in which it was created (in this case, `n` from `sample()`), and how you can define accessor methods to interact with those variables."

    "The `nonlocal` keyword in Python is used to declare that a variable is not local to the current function's scope, but it belongs to the nearest enclosing scope that is not global. In other words, it allows you to modify a variable in an outer, enclosing scope from an inner, nested scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `x` is a variable defined in the `outer_function`. The `inner_function` can access `x`, but if you want to modify it, you need to declare it as `nonlocal x`. This tells Python that when you refer to `x` inside `inner_function`, you're referring to the `x` from the nearest enclosing scope (in this case, `outer_function`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nonlocal` keyword is mainly used in nested functions when you want to modify a variable in an outer scope, but you want to avoid creating a new local variable with the same name. It bridges the gap between the local and global scopes, allowing you to modify variables in an intermediate (enclosing) scope."
